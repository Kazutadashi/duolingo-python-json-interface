# duolingo-python-json-interface
Python scripts and functions used with the Duolingo JSON page to gather useful information on language trees.

WARNING

For a majority of these functions to work, you must have a subdirectory with all of the JSON files
downloaded with each file named [Language].json

The subdirectory must ONLY contain these files and must only be named in this format or 
many of the data investigating functions will not operate.
